> This project is a **work in progress**. The API may change at any time.

From https://replit.com/site/terms, section 5 line 13: Launching any automated system that accesses the Service in a manner that sends more request messages to the Replit servers in a given period of time than a human can reasonably produce in the same period by using a conventional online web browser is prohibited.

## Install
```sh
npm install replapi-it
```
